#' Dichotomously-scored data for a 12th Grade science test
#'
#' Data obtained from the TESTFACT (Woods et al., 2003) manual, with 32 response pattern scored items for a grade 12 science assessment test (SAT) measuring topics of chemistry, biology, and physics. The scoring key for these data is [1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 4, 5], respectively. However, careful analysis using the nominal response model suggests that the scoring key for item 32 may be incorrect, and should be changed from 5 to 3.

#' Polytomous data from the Big Five Inventory-2
#'
#' Data obtained from the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2; Soto & John, 2017), collected from adolescents ages 14 to 17 years old enrolled in a high school AP Statistics course (Ober et al., 2021). The inventory contains 60 items on a 5-point Likert scale, where exactly 12 items load onto each of the five personality factors in the BFI-2 (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Negative Emotionality, and Open-Mindedness).  Data for 838 subjects was collected, after removing four subjects with missing data. No missing data remains. Variables are labeled by the first letter of the personality factor (e.g., E = Extraversion, A = Agreeableness, etc.) and item number 1 through 12. Items marked with a "R" were negatively worded on the assessment and responses have been computationally reverse coded.
